# README

A fellow intern asked how phisherman actually get the creds from a fake form.  So, I whipped up a quick rails app to show him how and tried, and failed, to phish our fellow interns. 

This was for educational purposes only and it not used in any way to phish any legitimate credentials.

Created with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL
